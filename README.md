The Applied Methods and Research Experience ( AMRE ) provides College of Wooster students with opportunities to apply classroom learning in the role of business and organizational consultants in the companies around Wooster, during an 8-week time period in summer 2016, me and my other three group members:
- conducted study on the previous forecasting model to predict the annual revenue based on the contracts that ArtiFlex gained during an 8-week period.
- Researched and learned about Visual Basic Application (VBA), a build-in programing language in Excel, to develop the capacity model.
